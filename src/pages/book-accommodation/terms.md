## Apartment availability
The Old Clink apartments are available all year but please [book in advance]([root]book-accommodation/) to avoid disappointment. Holiday stays are normally booked from Saturday to Saturday but alternative days and short stays may be possible.

## Accommodation tariff
Quoted prices are per apartment - not per person. Tariffs are charged according to the apartment and time of year. For more details, please refer to the [Annexe holiday apartment tariff]([root]apartment-1-annexe/#accommodation-tariff) and the [Flat holiday apartment tariff]([root]apartment-2-flat/#accommodation-tariff).

Please [contact Sarah]([root]book-accommodation/) to confirm your requirements and dates of stay. A non-refundable deposit is requested to reserve your accommodation. The remaining balance is due six weeks prior to arrival.

All prices are subject to change. Accommodation reservations confirmed by telephone, email, text, writing or any other communication method constitutes a legally-binding contract between you and The Old Clink.

## Accommodation retainer
A retainer of Â£50 is requested. This is returned at the end of your stay providing no damage or losses have occurred within the apartment.

## Cancellation
Deposits are non-refundable. A proportion of the balance minus costs will be refunded if the apartment is re-let.

We recommend you use travel cancellation insurance to cover the cost of any loss should unforeseen circumstances force you to cancel your holiday.

## Arrival and departure times
Unless agreed otherwise, your apartment will be ready from 3:00pm on the day of arrival. Please vacate the apartment by 10:00am on the day of departure.
