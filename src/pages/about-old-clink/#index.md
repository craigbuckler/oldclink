The Old Clink is one of the oldest buildings in East Devon. During the past few hundred years it has been a prison, an inn, a bank, a police station and even a smugglers den. The building's rich history can be discovered in the [Fairlynch Museum](http://fairlynchmuseum.uk/) opposite.

The Old Clink is the last remaining independent holiday accommodation in Budleigh Salterton. The famous, but unspoiled East Devon town has no hotels and just a handful of bed and breakfast options a few minutes away from the beach.

Both Old Clink apartments offer unparalleled, uninterrupted sea views. Direct access to the 5km pebble beach is just three steps away.
