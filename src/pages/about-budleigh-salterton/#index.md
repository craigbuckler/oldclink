> A place to soothe the soul. We love it here.
<cite>K &amp; R Masters, Newton Lonquille</cite>

Budleigh Salterton is a popular tourist location in an area of outstanding natural beauty on the Jurassic coast between Exmouth and Sidmouth. The small town has fewer than 6,000 residents but is less than half an hour's drive from Exeter, the capital of Devon.

Budleigh is busiest during the summer months but the mild west-country weather makes it suitable for off-season winter, Christmas and New Year breaks.

The promenade along the famous pebble beach leads to the Otter estuary. Things to do in Budleigh Salterton:
